    Every day, we count on technology to provide us with open communication to the people we love, reliable information on the world around us, and to share our creativity and experiences. But, while it might be free to post a story or a tweet, you pay with your data, the very uniqueness that makes you, and trust a centralized opaque system to deliver it to the world.

    The world needs an open platform to communicate, to share, and to publish, and the world needs builders like you to build it.
    
    LFGrow is an event for just that, using Lens Protocol as the foundation to create a social platform with digital ownership-first experiences, tools for transparent moderation, censorship-resistant ways to publish and profit, and much more.
    
    We can't wait to see what you build. LFGrow
